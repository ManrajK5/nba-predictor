## 🔍 What is Elo?

**Elo ratings** are a simple, effective way to rank competitors based on performance. Originally developed for chess, Elo is now widely used in sports like basketball, football, and esports.

- Every team starts with a base rating (typically 1500)
- Ratings adjust based on game results and opponent strength
- A higher Elo rating means a stronger team
- The difference between two teams' ratings gives the expected win probability

This app uses those Elo differences to predict outcomes using a machine learning model trained on historical NBA results.
